# Time-Series-Forecasting
Here is a time series forecasting model constructed by Prophet (developed by Meta). With this framework, one can easily build a fantastic time series model for data with significant seasonality. Compared with traditional time series models like ARIMA and VAR, this Prophet-based model could easily capture the seasonality features within a time series, which makes it possible to make long-run predictions. <br>
